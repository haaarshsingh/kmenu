# Nested Menus

Organize your command menu.

## Introduction

Nested menus are menus that are accessible from commands in other menus, and are there to help you structure your command menu interface.

Let's start by taking a look at the nested menus on Vercel's dashboard. You can click on the "search deployments" command from the main menu to open up a nested menu with all of your deployments.

On this website, you can also see an example of nested menus opening the menu and clicking "search documentation" or "links".

## Implementation

This library uses indexes to organize and handle the opening/closing different menus. The main menu should have an index of 1, and if you want to open up nested menus, simply use the `setOpen` method exported from `useKmenu`. You can also use [breadcrumbs](/docs/commands/commands-example#breadcrumbs) to further categorize and aid navigation between the menus.

Note: if you're going to nest a menu, it's best practice to add "..." to the command which opens the nested menu so that users know it's nested.

Here is an implementation of the above:

```tsx:CommandMenu.tsx
export default () => {
  const { setOpen } = useKmenu()

  const main = [{
    /* ... */
    commands: [{
      {
        icon: <Cloud />,
        text: 'Deployments...',
        perform: () => setOpen(2),
      },
    }]
  }];
  const deployments = [/* ... */];

  const [mainCommands] = useCommands(main);
  const [deploymentCommands] = useCommands(deployments);

  return (
    <CommandWrapper>
      <CommandMenu commands={mainCommands} index={1} crumbs={['Home']} />
      <CommandMenu commands={deploymentCommands} index={2} crumbs={['Home', 'Deployments']} />
    </CommandWrapper>
  );
};
```

See [this page](/docs/hooks/usekmenu-hook) more information on the `useKmenu` hook.

You can also make any commands from nested menus accessible (but hidden) the main menu so using the `subCommands` object in the `Command` type. This way, if the user has a command memorized he doesn't need to navigate through your menus to use it.
