# Loading States

Dynamically load data into your command menu.

## Introduction

Not all menu items that you'd want to put on this menu have to be static, and we have a fix for that. Using hooks from `useKmenu`, you can fetch data from an API and dynamically load it in when the user selects that option from your menu.

Additionally, you can even display your own loading spinner or any other element while you wait for the data.

## Implementation

For this implementation, we're going to create a nested menu with two arrays of commands. The first array will be the main command, with a command to open the nested menu, and the second array with be an empty array where the commands will be loaded in. We're also going to create a React hook for the loading state. We'll also use the `useKmenu` hook to see whether the menu that we want to fetch data for is actually open.

```tsx:CommandMenu.tsx
const main = [/* ... */]

const [mainCommands] = useCommands(commands)
const [projectCommands, setProjectCommands] = useCommands([])

const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)

const { open } = useKmenu()
```

Next, we're gonna check to see if the currently opened menu is the correct one, fetch our data, and then use the setter to map that data into our project commands:

```tsx:CommandMenu.tsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (open === 2) {
    setLoading(true)
    // try {} catch (error) {}
  }
}, [open])
```

After you fetch, simply map the data into your commands array using the setter and set your loading state to false.
