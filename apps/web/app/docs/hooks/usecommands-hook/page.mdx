# useCommands

Utilities for working with your commands in the menu.

## Introduction

With [kmenu v1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kmenu/v/1.0.0-dev), you can now dynamically compute and define commands.

Before you pass your commands into the menu, they're required to be inputted into the `useCommands` hook, where they return an object of command-menu parsable commands along with a setter to dynamically compute and define commands.

Here is what the hook takes:

| Parameter | Description         | Type      |
| --------- | ------------------- | --------- |
| command   | Your commands array | Command[] |

This is what the hook returns:

| Parameter | Description                                | Type           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| getter    | The final computed commands                | InnerCommand[] |
| setter    | The setter function to change the commands | void           |

NOTE: You cannot `setCommands` directly inside of a `useEffect` hook at render.

## Example

Here's an example of the hook live in action:

```tsx:CommandMenu.tsx
const main = [/* ... */]

export default (() => {
  const [commands, setCommands] = useCommands(main)
  return <CommandMenu commands={commands} crumbs={['Home']} index={1} />
})
```
