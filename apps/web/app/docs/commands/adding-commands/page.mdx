# Adding Commands

Now that we setup the menu, let's add commands to it.

## Commands Object

The commands are broken up into two arrays: an array that contains the different categories of the commands, and another array contains the commands itself. Here's how you can define categories:

| Parameter   | Description                                                             | Type    | Optional |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| category    | The name of the category the command will be displayed in               | string  | ❌       |
| commands    | An array of commands passed onto the category                           | Command | ❌       |
| subCommands | An array of commands passed onto the category only accessible by search | Command | ✅       |

## Creating Commands

Here's a look at how you can create commands:

| Parameter       | Description                                               | Type         | Optional |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------- |
| icon            | The icon displayed next to the command                    | ReactElement | ✅       |
| text            | The text displayed on the command                         | string       | ❌       |
| perform         | The action to perform                                     | void         | ✅       |
| href            | The link to open                                          | void         | ✅       |
| newTab          | Whether or not the link should open in a new tab          | boolean      | ✅       |
| keywords        | Search keywords for the command                           | string       | ✅       |
| shorcuts        | The keyboard shortcuts displayed on the command           | Shortcut     | ✅       |
| closeOnComplete | Whether the menu should close after command executes      | boolean      | ✅       |
| anchor          | Allow for custom HTML to be passed as the anchor property | NavLink      | ✅       |
| checkbox        | Add a checkbox to the command                             | Checkbox     | ✅       |

You can read more about keyboard shortcuts on the [next page](/docs/commands/keyboard-shortcuts). Here is a breakdown of some other properties:

### Checkbox

You can read more about checkboxes [here](/docs/features/checkboxes).

### Anchor

This is to use elements like [next/link](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link) to add prefetching and client-side navigation between routes. This is of type `AnchorHTMLAttributes<HTMLAnchorElement>` and allows you to simply pass in the link component itself.

However, my suggested approach with Next.js is using the `perform` function with the `useRouter` hook, and using the push function to redirect the user to the desired route.

## Creating a Commands Array

We can create our commands array like this:

```tsx:CommandMenu.tsx
import type { Command } from 'kmenu'

const main: Command[] = [
  {
    category: 'Utility',
    commands: [
      {
        icon: <Dashboard />,
        text: 'Dashboard',
        href: '/dashboard',
        keywords: ['home', 'back'],
      },
      {
        icon: <Cloud />,
        text: 'Deployments',
        href: '/deployments',
      },
      {
        icon: <ArrowLeft />,
        text: 'Previous',
        perform: () => navigateToPreviousPage(),
        keywords: ['back']
      },
    ],
    subCommands: [
      {
        icon: <ExternalLink />,
        text: 'Home',
        href: '/',
        newTab: true,
      },
    ],
  },
]
```
