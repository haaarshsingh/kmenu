# Theming

The simplest approach to adjusting your command menus to light or dark mode is via CSS selectors on your root variables. Here's an example:

```css:cmdk.css
.kmenu {
  /* regular variables */
}

html.dark .kmenu {
  /* dark mode variables */
}
```

Alternatively, if you're using Tailwind, you can use the `dark:` selector to do the same in each of the class names. This is the approach that this website takes, you can view the styling here[](#) for a sample implementation.

Additionally, here is an [example](#) of a menu with light and dark mode toggle using CSS selectors. More examples and content will be published on this page soon.
