# With Tailwind CSS

Due to limitations with this library not being headless, you cannot use Tailwind's inline approach to style menu items. Instead, you can opt for the [@apply directive](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#apply) approach in your CSS file.

You can copy a version of kmenu that applies all style values using the apply directive from [here](#) and copy paste it into the your project. Alternatively, you can find a blank CSS file [here](/docs/customization/with-css#style-it-yourself) if you wish to start from scratch.

More examples and content will be published on this page soon.
