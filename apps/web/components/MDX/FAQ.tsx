          We may in the future but it's not on the roadmap for now. This library
          is currently only made to be used with React, although I encourage any
          pull requests to make kmenu framework agnostic or even port it to
          frameworks such as Vue.

          Currently this library uses Framer Motion to animate various menu
          actions. I am currently working on finding alternative solutions for
          the animations but it's not a priority as of now.

          you wish. Check out{" "}

          Not as of now, although the animations are disabled based if the user
          has the "prefers reduced motion" setting enabled. Additionally, some
          animations are disbaled on Firefox due to issues with compatibility.
